## Vision: hifzul

### Mission Alignment
- Anchor on Quran.Foundation’s call for engineers who enhance existing systems, prioritize sustainability, and document rigorously, ensuring this project showcases those strengths.[^role]
- Support millions of seekers by emphasizing accessibility-first interactions, energy-aware design choices, and maintainable architecture over flashy but brittle experiments.

### Iterative Experience Pillars
1. **Interactive Memorization & Recitation Coach** (current focus)  
   Guided listen–repeat–recite loops, adaptive prompts, and focused audio tooling.
2. **Deep Study Companion**  
   Tafsir, translation correlation, linguistic overlays, and reflection capture.
3. **Narrative Journey Mode**  
   Chapter progress visualized as journeys (Hijrah, expeditions, thematic arcs) to motivate long-term engagement.

### Key Differentiators
- **Holistic Sensing:** Combine verse metadata, translations, tafsir snippets, and recitation analytics to generate targeted guidance instead of generic flashcards.
- **Sustainable Delivery:** Aggressive caching, incremental data hydration, and minimal over-fetching demonstrate stewardship of infra resources.
- **Documentation Forward:** Every feature lands with product briefs, architectural notes, and testing evidence to reflect the team’s knowledge-sharing culture.

### Success Criteria
- Demonstrate seamless OAuth2 integration with Quran.Foundation APIs, including responsible token lifecycle handling.
- Showcase one polished memorization pathway end-to-end (selection → coaching loop → reflection spark) with instrumentation for future optimization.
- Provide a visible roadmap trailhead in `README.md` communicating how subsequent study and narrative iterations will build on the same core.
